This project demonstrates how to create interactive drag-and-drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can visually move folders represented as HTML elements between two designated boxes on the screen. HTML structures the page and creates the boxes and folders. CSS styles the appearance of the elements. JavaScript implements the drag and drop behavior, allowing users to grab and move folders from one box to another.
